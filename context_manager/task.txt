### Pivot Table implementation"

**Context:** Merged cells break the 1:1 relationship between grid coordinates and visual layout. This is one of the hardest features to implement in a custom grid engine.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Complete implementation of Pivot Table implementation as it is in Excel

**Current Status:**
We have a first version of a full implementation of the Pivot Table feature.
I select the range B2:C5, shown in the image, and insert a pivot table. 
After clicking "OK" in the pivot table dialog I see the pivot table appearing.
However, I dont see a pivot table pane where I can edit the layout, change aggregations etc.
Maybe we dont have this code in the repo yet, so please investigate that.
If we dont have it, go ahead and create it.
