Implement the Undo/Redo Stack (The Time Machine)
**Context:** A spreadsheet without Undo is unusable.
We now have implemented undo and redo in the backend, in these files.
- src-tauri/src/commands.rs
- src-tauri/src/lib.rs
- src-tauri/src/undo_commands.rs

Next step is to implement undo and redo so that they can be used with keyboard shortcuts 
(Ctrl + Z and Ctrl + Y).
We do not have to add any icons, buttons or anything else "visible" in the frontend.
