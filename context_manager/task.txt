## Shifting columns and rows
I notice that if I insert a column or row it correctly shifts the values in the existing cells a corresponding amount of rows down or colums to the left.
Vice versa, deleting columns and rows works as expected.
However, it does not shift the size of the columns and rows, this is something we must fix.
For example, I resize column C to have width X. Then I insert a column at column B.
I would then expect column C to shift one step to the left so that column now has have width X.

In addition, I would like to add to the right click menu the ability to type in the width of a column, and the height of a row.
Much like one is able to do that in Excel.
