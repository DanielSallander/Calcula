**The arrow key bug**
- The arrow key have stopped working. I cannot navigate using the arrow keys anymore.
This worked until recently when app/src/components/Spreadsheet/Spreadsheet.tsx got updated.
**Column selection**
When selecting a column it navigates all the way to the bottom. 
Just as in Excel, selecting a column should not mean expandning the used range to the bottom.
One should be able to reference a column (for example "B:B") without necessary expanding the used range to include all rows in this column.
I hope it is clear what I mean. Basically I want the same behavior as in Excel.
