We must improve the range selection.
When I drag and select a range of cells only those cells that are more than 50% covered by the cursor should be included.
So lets say I start at cell B1. I drag and select down to B2. 
Only when the cursor is crossing 50% of its "hitbox" it should include B2 in its selection.
Then I continue to drag to the left to A2.
Only when the cursor is crossing 50% of its hitbox on cell A2 should this cell be included.
This will finally result in range A1:B2 being included in the selection.
