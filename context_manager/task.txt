### Pivot Table implementation"

**Context:** Merged cells break the 1:1 relationship between grid coordinates and visual layout. This is one of the hardest features to implement in a custom grid engine.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Complete implementation of Pivot Table implementation as it is in Excel

**Current Status:**
We have a first working version of the Pivot Table.
As a use case I have this:
I have data, with headers, in range B2:C5. The I select this range and insert a pivot table.
After clicking "OK" in the pivot table dialog I see the pivot table appearing and a pivot table pane where I can edit the layout, change aggregations etc.
The following issues is whar we need to fix / improve:
- The pivot table is instantiated with a reserved area. However, we do not see this reserved area. In Excel there is like a startup image.
In our solution it is enough to have a white rectangle. Let us make the reserved area 18 rows and 3 columns in size.
- When a user trying to edit a cell or range of cells in the reserved area the solution is rightfully denying that.
However we should also get a pop-up message saying "You can't change this part of the PivotTable".
- When a cell is selected that is located within the pivot area the pivot pane should be visible. Otherwise it should be hidden.
