### Pivot Table implementation"

**Context:** Merged cells break the 1:1 relationship between grid coordinates and visual layout. This is one of the hardest features to implement in a custom grid engine.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Complete implementation of Pivot Table implementation as it is in Excel

**Current Status:**
We have a first working version of the Pivot Table.
As a use case I have this:
I have data, with headers (A and B), in range B2:C5. Then I select this range and insert a pivot table.
A pivot table is correctly created and I can drag a field onto rows pane.
We have these issues to address:
- There seems to be a bug in how the pivot table is updated when a change of the layout is done.
For example. if I put column A on rows nothing happens. 
And when I remove column A from rows the pivot table is layouted with column A on rows.

Here is the console messages from when I add column A to rows and then remove it from rows.
[Layout] Pivot view updated, refreshing grid
GridCanvas.tsx:652 [GridCanvas] grid:refresh event received - refreshing cells
GridCanvas.tsx:386 [GridCanvas] refreshCells called
GridCanvas.tsx:351 [Cells] Fetched 8 cells. First cell: row=1, col=1, display="A", styleIndex=0, rowSpan=1, colSpan=1

I have also attached an image where you can see this scenario.
