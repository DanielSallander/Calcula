We should now implement the **Name Box**.
I have attached a screenshot to clarify what box I mean.

We should implement these two functions:

* **Displays Active Cell:** It shows the address of the currently selected cell (e.g., if you click cell A1, it says "A1").
* **Navigation:** You can type a cell address (like Z1000) or a defined name into the box and press Enter to jump directly to that location.
