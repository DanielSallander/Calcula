Something is causing a hanging issue when I type a formula that sums an entire column - for instance "=SUM(B:B)".
Right after I write a formula that sums an entire column I can no longer navigate with keyboard arrows and automatic calculation does not work. I dont think it has to do with the arrow keys or automatic calculation, they are merely symtoms of something else hanging (this is what I think at least).
However, if I go back and edit the same cell and just press enter, everything works fine again.

Here are the console messages if that helps:
