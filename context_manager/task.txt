The cursor seems to point wrong.
If I point and click a cell it select a cell under it. 
Also, if I try to resize the row height I have to grab the resize handle slightly above the handle.
So it seems like in general there is an offset of the cursor and where it actually points.
I have attached a screenshot. It is marked with a red cross when I click to and the blue square is the cell that is selected.
