There is an issue with automatic calculations across sheets.
Lets say I have two sheets - Sheet1 and Sheet2.
I am in cell A1 in Sheet2 and I edit it, I write: "=SUM(Sheet1!B1:B8)"
Then I go to cell 5 Sheet 1 and put in value 5.
Then I go back to Sheet2 and I expect A1 to be updated. However, this is not the case.
In addition, when I am editing a cell, in point mode, and I go to another sheet and point to some cells, 
I have to click on the inline editor, the formula bar, to continue writing the formula. It is sort of as it loses focus of the cell editing when going to another sheet in point mode.

Below are messages from the console when I performed this operation:
