### Implement "Merge Cells"

**Context:** Merged cells break the 1:1 relationship between grid coordinates and visual layout. This is one of the hardest features to implement in a custom grid engine.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Data Structure:** Update `CellData` in Rust to include `row_span` and `col_span`.
2.  **Rendering Logic:** Update `drawCellText` and `drawGridLines`.
    * The renderer must check if a cell is part of a merge.
    * If it is the "Master" cell (top-left), it draws across the total width/height of the spanned columns/rows.
    * If it is a "Slave" cell (obscured by the merge), it skips rendering entirely.
3.  **Selection Model:** Update `useSelection.ts`. If a user selects a cell that is part of a merge, the selection rect must expand to encompass the entire merged area automatically.
4.  **Menu commands:** Update the "Edit" (on the top) to include a command to merge selected cells.

**Current Status:**
We have working version, the commands appear in the "Edit" menu.
Everything is almost done.
We have these issues that remains to be fixed:
- *Navigating through merged cells*. Lets say we have cells C3 and D3 merged and I have C2 currently selected. With the arrow keys I go down to the merged cell and then down one step more. It lands on D4. It should land on C4.
    It lands correct if I go down from D2 -> D4.
- *Interaction with frozen panes*. When having frozen panes active the merged cells is not properly showing in the grid. It is showing the merged cells as unmerged cells, not rendering them properly.
