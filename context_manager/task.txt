We must fix the scrollbar (both horizontal and vertical).
When scrolling the "thumb", "handle" as it may be called, is always stuck on top for vertical scrollbars
and stuck to the left for the horizontal scrollbars.
Probably this has to do with the scaling of the scrollbar itself with respect to the used range.
We need to properly implement it as it is in Excel.
