We have now introduced a right-mouse-click menu.
It appears as it should.
However, the we do not have any commands connected to the items yet.
Go ahead and create the commands associated with each item:
- Cut
- Copy
- Paste
- Clear Contents
- Insert Row
- Insert Column
In addition, I notice that if I select a range of cells and right click it unselects the range and only selects the cell that is right clicked on.
This should change so that the selection on the range is intact, and then any item that is selected in the menu should be applied to that selection.
