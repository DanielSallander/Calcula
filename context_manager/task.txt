# Pivot table filter

We now have the pivot table filter displayed in cells above the rows and columns of the pivot table.
We have the pivot filter correctly as a drop down list when clicking the cell (see the image).
The drop down frontend is mainly handled in app\src\core\components\pivot\FilterDropdown.tsx
Now we must implement so that the values in the pivot filter is correctly populated from the data.
The list of values shown in the pivot filter should be unique values of the field its using.
