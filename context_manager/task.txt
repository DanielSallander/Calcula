## F4 toggle
We are working on the F4-toggle function.
When pressing F4 the formula reference lock should toggle this => fully locked => rows only => columns only => unlocked.
Basically it should work as in Excel.

### Current status
We have done four iterations of this task already but still it is not working as expected.
It works to edit a cell, click a cell to refence it and subsequently click F4.
It does not work to edit a cell, click a cell to refence it, press enter, and then go back to edit the same cell and click F4.
In this last scenario nothing happens when pressing F4.
