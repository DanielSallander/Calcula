### Pivot Table implementation"

**Context:** Merged cells break the 1:1 relationship between grid coordinates and visual layout. This is one of the hardest features to implement in a custom grid engine.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Complete implementation of Pivot Table implementation as it is in Excel

**Current Status:**
We have a first working version of the Pivot Table.
As a use case I have this:
I have data, with headers (A and B), in range B2:C5. Then I select this range and insert a pivot table.
A pivot table is correctly created and I can drag a field onto rows pane.
We have these issues to address:
- I would like to implement drag and drop, so that I can drag fields onto the different layout panes.
