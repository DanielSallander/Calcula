There is an issue when referencing across sheets.
Lets say I have two sheets - Sheet1 and Sheet2.
I am in cell A1 in Sheet2 and I edit it, I write: "=SUM(" - I am in point mode.
So I go to Sheet1 and select the range A1:A7.
Now the problem is that I am still seeing the cell I am editing (as shown in the attached image).
It should be as in Excel that when I am in point mode and go to another sheet I see that sheet and not the cell I am editing.
However, I should see the cell I am editing in the inline editor (formula bar).

Below are messages from the console when I performed this operation:
[InlineEditor] Focused input, cursor at position: 0
