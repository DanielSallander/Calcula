We have implemented the **Insert Function** button.
- Cancel button (X) - Red, calls cancelEdit()
- Enter button (checkmark) - Green, calls commitEdit()
- Insert Function button (fx) - Opens the function dialog
- Formula input - Syncs with cell editing, shows formula/value
- Insert Function Dialog - Searchable, categorized function picker
- Smart formula completion - Auto-closes missing parentheses when committing

However, it is not showing in the app.
I suspect the components is not implemented properly (I think app/src/core/components/Spreadsheet/Spreadsheet.tsx is central here).

These are the files that was added or updated:
- app/src/core/hooks/useEditing.ts
- app/src/core/lib/formulaCompletion.ts
- shell/FormulaBar/FormulaBar.tsx
- shell/FormulaBar/FormulaInput.tsx
- shell/FormulaBar/index.ts
- shell/FormulaBar/InsertFunctionDialog.tsx
