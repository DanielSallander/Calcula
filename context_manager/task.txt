# Fix error
app/src/core/state/gridActions.ts was recently refactored.
Some logic was moved here:
app/extensions/BuiltIn/FindReplaceDialog/useFindStore.ts 
and here: 
app/extensions/BuiltIn/FindReplaceDialog/FindReplaceDialog.tsx

This is the error I get:
Spreadsheet.tsx:8  Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/src/core/state/gridActions.ts' does not provide an export named 'openFind' (at Spreadsheet.tsx:8:33)
