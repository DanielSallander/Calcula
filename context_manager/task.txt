## Cells editing
When clicking and editing a cell I can click a cell to reference it.
In the attached image I have two values in B-column. 
Then in C3 I type in "=" and click cell B4. After that I cannot type anything or press enter. 
However, if I click another cell it exits edit mode and commits the value. Then I can go back to C3 and edit it normally. 
However, as soon as I click a cell to reference it I cannot type anymore.
