### Pivot Table implementation"

**Context:** Merged cells break the 1:1 relationship between grid coordinates and visual layout. This is one of the hardest features to implement in a custom grid engine.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Complete implementation of Pivot Table implementation as it is in Excel

**Current Status:**
We have a first working version of the Pivot Table.
As a use case I have this:
I have data, with headers, in range B2:C5. Then I select this range and insert a pivot table.
A pivot table is correctly created and I can drag a field onto rows pane.
We have these issues to address:
- The Pivot Area seems to not be correctly set. In the startup, when no fields are applied it is correctly setting a reserved area.
But after applying fields the rows beneath the headers are outside the pivot area. We must fix so that the pivot area always encapsulates
the whole area that contains values and fields layouted in the sheet.
- Pivot table is not updating properly when adding and removing fields to any of the pivot panes (rows, columns, filters, values).
For example, after applying and removing a field the pivot table is still showing values.
(Maybe this is connected to the first issue).
