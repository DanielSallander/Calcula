I would like to introduce a right-mouse-click menu.
It should appear when right clicking the mouse.
And we **must** prepare it for extensibility. What I mean is that I want other people to be able to build extensions here.
Much like one has the possibility to extend the right mouse click menu in VSCode.
One more thing. Now when you right mouse click you get the option to get the developer tools (when we are now developing).
I want to keep this option, so please come up with an idea of how we should handle that.
