### Implement "Merge Cells"

**Context:** Merged cells break the 1:1 relationship between grid coordinates and visual layout. This is one of the hardest features to implement in a custom grid engine.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Data Structure:** Update `CellData` in Rust to include `row_span` and `col_span`.
2.  **Rendering Logic:** Update `drawCellText` and `drawGridLines`.
    * The renderer must check if a cell is part of a merge.
    * If it is the "Master" cell (top-left), it draws across the total width/height of the spanned columns/rows.
    * If it is a "Slave" cell (obscured by the merge), it skips rendering entirely.
3.  **Selection Model:** Update `useSelection.ts`. If a user selects a cell that is part of a merge, the selection rect must expand to encompass the entire merged area automatically.
4.  **Menu commands:** Update the "Edit" (on the top) to include a command to merge selected cells.

**Current Status:**
We have implemented a first version, the commands appear in the "Edit" menu.
When I apply "Merge Cells" it looks like the cell is merged.
However, when I select the merged cell it only selects the part of it, as it was never merged.
I have attached an image.
In the image I have merged cells B2 and C2.

Below are messages from the console:
