We now have insert / delete column and row commands, and these are connected to the right mouse button click menu.
I notice that when inserting columns there is a small glitchiness.
The columns shifts correctly to the commanded position.
However, for a very brief small moment the values in the column that was shifted 
flickers and shows briefly in the position it was shifted from.
I suspect this has to do with the animation, or "smoothness", we implemented when shifting columns.

In addition, we must implement animation for deleting rows and columns as well.
Now we only have animation for inserting rows and columns.

These files were updated when we implemented the smoothing feature:
