We an issue with editing cells that makes it a bit "glitchy".
The arises when editing in this way:
1. User writes something, lets say "hello" in a cell, lets say cell A1
2. User press enter and the value is commited to the cell
3. User goes back to A1 to append something else to the existing value, lets say " world".
4. User press enter.
This creates some issue where one is left in edit mode but cannot write anything.
Looking at the formula bar it looks like its still in edit mode.
However, one can still click on other cells, but not type in anything.
It hard to describe exactly what going on but I hope this gives an idea of what is happening:

Below are messages from the console if that gives any idea:
