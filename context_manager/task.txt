We have recently implemented Find and Replace commands.
I can fire the command and the dialog comes up as it should (app/src/core/components/FindReplaceDialog/FindReplaceDialog.tsx).
However, I cannot enter anything in either Find textbox or Replace textbox.
If I type anything there it instead edits whatever cell I currently have selected.
