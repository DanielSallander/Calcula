When using arrow keys to navigate out of view the viewport should move along with the navigation so that
it always shows entire cells, not only a half cell - atleast as long as the cell is not bigger than the viewport.
Check the attached image - the L-column is extending beyond the viewport to the right.
In addition, if I use the hotkey Ctrl + any arrow key the view port is not following. 
I think the main logic resides in app/src/state/gridReducer.ts
