**Resizing row height**
When resizing row height it first "jumps" to increase row height.
It does not matter if I increase or decrease row height.
As soon as the handle is dragged to start the increase/decrease operation it performs this "jump" in row height increase.
I would say that this jump in row height is approximately the equivalent to a default row height.
