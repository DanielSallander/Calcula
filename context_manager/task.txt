### Implement "Freeze Panes" (Sticky Headers)

**Context:** currently, the `viewport.ts` calculates a single visible range based on scroll position. To support sticky headers (Top Row / First Column), the rendering engine must handle split viewports.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Viewport Splitting:** The Canvas renderer (`GridCanvas.tsx`) needs to render up to four distinct zones if both rows and columns are frozen:
    * Top-Left (Static)
    * Top-Right (Scrolls Horizontally only)
    * Bottom-Left (Scrolls Vertically only)
    * Bottom-Right (Fully Scrollable)
2.  **Coordinate Translation:** The `getCellFromPixel` logic in `hitTesting.ts` must account for the offset of frozen rows/cols so that clicking a frozen header doesn't register as clicking a scrolled cell underneath it.


## Current status
We have the freeze panes commands in place and they are selectable from the "View" menu.
When applying the freezing pane commands the cells looks weird, like they are slightly offseted.
Take a look at the attached images to compare. One image shows when freezing panes are not applied and the other shows when it is applied.
Also, when scrolling down it looks like, on the row numbers in the margin are increasing even for the frozen row.
However, the first row does indeed looks frozen.
