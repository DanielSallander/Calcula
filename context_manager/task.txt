### Implement "Merge Cells"

**Context:** Merged cells break the 1:1 relationship between grid coordinates and visual layout. This is one of the hardest features to implement in a custom grid engine.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Data Structure:** Update `CellData` in Rust to include `row_span` and `col_span`.
2.  **Rendering Logic:** Update `drawCellText` and `drawGridLines`.
    * The renderer must check if a cell is part of a merge.
    * If it is the "Master" cell (top-left), it draws across the total width/height of the spanned columns/rows.
    * If it is a "Slave" cell (obscured by the merge), it skips rendering entirely.
3.  **Selection Model:** Update `useSelection.ts`. If a user selects a cell that is part of a merge, the selection rect must expand to encompass the entire merged area automatically.
4.  **Menu commands:** Update the "Edit" (on the top) to include a command to merge selected cells.

**Current Status:**
We have implemented a first version, the commands appear in the "Edit" menu,
but when I apply "Merge Cells" I dont see that the cells are being merged, at least it does not show in the grid.
However, it seems like merge is happening in the background since I get the message that I cannot merge overlapping cells when I try to
merge cells that has already been merged.

Here are the messages from the console:
[MenuBar] handleItemClick: Merge Cells disabled: false hasAction: true
MenuBar.tsx:193 [MenuBar] handleMergeCells called with selection: {startRow: 8, startCol: 1, endRow: 8, endCol: 3, type: 'cells'}
tauri-api.ts:564 [tauri-api] mergeCells(8, 1, 8, 3)
tauri-api.ts:571 [tauri-api] mergeCells result: {success: true, mergedRegions: Array(2), updatedCells: Array(1)}
MenuBar.tsx:201 [MenuBar] mergeCells result: {success: true, mergedRegions: Array(2), updatedCells: Array(1)}

The most recent update was done in commands.rs.
The fix there was to update get_viewport_cells and get_cell_internal to check the merged regions and populate the correct spans.
