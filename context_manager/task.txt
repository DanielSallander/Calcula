There is a small bug in the automatic calculation.
If I use a formula on a entire column that is empty, meaning that no cells in this column have any values, the automatic calculation stop.
The formula is not recalculating when I subsequently add a number to any cell in this column that was references in the formula. 
For example: I put "=SUM(B:B)" in cell A1. Column B is empty, no cells there have any values. Cell A1 is now showing 0.
If I then go to for example cell B3 and put the value 5 this should normally trigger a recalculating and cell A1 is now showing 5.
This is not the case, it is still showing 0. 
However, if I go back to A1 and just press enter, recommiting the formula, it correctly calculates and shows 5.
And if I change B3 to 7 it is correctly recalculating cell A1 and now shows 7.
