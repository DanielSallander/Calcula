### Implement "Merge Cells"

**Context:** Merged cells break the 1:1 relationship between grid coordinates and visual layout. This is one of the hardest features to implement in a custom grid engine.

**Requirements:**
1.  **Data Structure:** Update `CellData` in Rust to include `row_span` and `col_span`.
2.  **Rendering Logic:** Update `drawCellText` and `drawGridLines`.
    * The renderer must check if a cell is part of a merge.
    * If it is the "Master" cell (top-left), it draws across the total width/height of the spanned columns/rows.
    * If it is a "Slave" cell (obscured by the merge), it skips rendering entirely.
3.  **Selection Model:** Update `useSelection.ts`. If a user selects a cell that is part of a merge, the selection rect must expand to encompass the entire merged area automatically.
4.  **Menu commands:** Update the "Edit" (on the top) to include a command to merge selected cells.

**Current Status:**
We have working version, the commands appear in the "Edit" menu.
When I apply "Merge Cells" it looks like the cell is merged, the edit works and I can navigate properly to and from the merged cell.
These issues remain to be fixed:
- If I edit a merged cell I dont see the content in the inline editor (formula bar), as in the attached image. However, the content appear in the inline editor as soon as i start to add content to the cell.
- drag selecting onto a merged cell causes the only the part that is drag selected to be included, not the whole merged cell. It should expand the selection to include and detect the border of the whole merged cell.
    This means that the expanded borders should also include adjacent cells that falls within these new border.
