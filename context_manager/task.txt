## Drag selection
When drag selecting columns it works when drag selecting from left to right but not from right to left. 
Same with rows, it works when drag selecting top to down but not down to up. 
This should be changed so that columns and rows can be drag selected from both directions.

I notice also that when drag selecting a column from left to right, while holding down the mouse button, 
the selection flickers between the top cell in the column you start in and selection that is held.

So in general we need to improve the smoothness of the drag selection here.
