# Pivot table filter

We now have the pivot table filter displayed in cells above the rows and columns of the pivot table (see attached image).
However, I cannot click the cell that should contain the filters (the cell that contains "(All)").
This should be a drop down list with unique values of the field currently used as filter, in this case column A.
Also, as seen in the other image there is now this strange scrollbar in the "Choose fields to add to report" area.
Lets remove this scrollbar and have objects inside fit to the size of the container instead.
