When using Ctrl + any arrow key the view port is not following. 
For example, I stand in cell "A1" and I press Ctrl + arrow key down
it seems like the cells is not moved to the bottom, at least the viewport is not moving to this position.
Maybe we need more logging that tracks where the current position is, cell or range, that is currently selected.
