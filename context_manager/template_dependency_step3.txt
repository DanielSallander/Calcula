================================================================================
Please provide the output as a single Unified Diff block containing all changes.
**Strict Format Rules:**
1. Start each file's section with a header specifying the filename:
`--- path/to/filename.ext`
`+++ path/to/filename.ext`
2. Follow with the standard diff hunks (`@@ -old,len +new,len @@`).
3. Do not include `a/` or `b/` prefixes in the filenames.
4. Do not use Markdown code blocks for individual files; put the ENTIRE output in one single code block."
5. Keep answers brief. Just the Unified Diff block and a short summary.

Never update files you have not "seen" yet. Request those files first.
