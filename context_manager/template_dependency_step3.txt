                                 INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================
Please provide code updates using the following "Block Replacement" format.
Do not use Diff or Unified format. Use the custom tags shown below.

TAGS FORMAT:
<<<< FILE: path/to/file.ext >>>>
<<<< SEARCH: exact_line_or_keyword >>>>
<<<< CODE >>>>
... content ...
<<<< END >>>>

MODES:
1. UPDATE EXISTING BLOCK (Function/Class):
   - FILE: Path to existing file.
   - SEARCH: The exact function signature or unique starting line.
   - CODE: The complete replacement block. 
   - RULE: The first non-empty line of the CODE block must match the SEARCH line exactly. Do NOT include decorators/attributes in CODE unless they are also in SEARCH.

2. CREATE NEW FILE:
   - FILE: Path to the new file.
   - SEARCH: Create New File
   - CODE: The full content of the new file.

3. APPEND TO FILE (Add new function/class):
   - FILE: Path to existing file.
   - SEARCH: Append to End
   - CODE: The new code block to add at the bottom of the file.

4. DELETE BLOCK:
   - FILE: Path to existing file.
   - SEARCH: The exact function signature or unique starting line to delete.
   - CODE: DELETE_BLOCK

Rules:
- For Typescript/Rust: Ensure the SEARCH line matches the code exactly.
- Avoid unicode characters in the response.
- You can provide multiple file updates in one response.

Keep answers brief. Just the block replacement content and a short summary.

Never update files you have not "seen" yet. Request those files first.
