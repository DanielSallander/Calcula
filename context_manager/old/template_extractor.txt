# INSTRUCTIONS
**STEP 1: SANITY CHECK**
Before writing any code, ask yourself: "Do I see all the file definitions needed to solve the task?"
* Check for missing Type definitions.
* Check for missing API calls or Backend Commands.
* Check for missing imports that are crucial to the logic.

**STEP 2: DECISION**
* **IF files are missing:**
    STOP immediately. Return ONLY the build command with the *combined* list of current files plus the missing ones.
    Format: "python context_manager.py build --files <current_files>,<missing_file_1>,<missing_file_2>"

* **IF context is complete:**
    Proceed to implement the requested changes.
    1. If you modify a file, you MUST update its top-level docstring/comment.
