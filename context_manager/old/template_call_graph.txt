                         CODE STRUCTURE
================================================================================

The following is a structural outline of the relevant code paths. This is NOT 
the full source code - it shows function signatures, call relationships, and 
type definitions to help you understand the architecture.

IMPORTANT: After reviewing this outline, you must request the specific code 
you need to complete the task. Do NOT attempt to solve the task with only 
this outline - you need to see the actual implementations.
Only request code that exists in the provided call graph.

Please analyze the code structure and help me understand how cell formatting 
is applied when the user clicks a formatting button. Specifically:

1. How does the frontend trigger the formatting command?
2. How does the backend apply the style to the cell?
3. Where is the style data stored?

After reviewing the outline, request the specific code you need to answer 
these questions.
